# Nine Men's Morris

A Ruby terminal implementation of the board game known as Nine Men's Morris for a final group project (Software Design IV: Software Architecture and System Design course). The game was developed by our team using the documents created by another team throughout the semester and communicating with the design team as necessary. Our Team DAMMN designed Fanarona throughout the semester for another team to implement, whereas we implemented Nine Men's Morris based on the designs of a different team.

## About the Game

As the initially provided design documents changed throughout the development process when our team found flaws in the existing design, both the initial and final design documents have been included. Also, note that due to the course falling behind schedule the professor provided the option for all teams to make a terminal-based game instead of the initially designed web-based game. Our team accepted the alternative option and proceeded to implement a terminal-based version of Nine Men's Morris using the web-based game designs we were provided.
