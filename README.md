# Nine_Mens_Morris
A Ruby terminal implementation of the board game known as Nine Men's Morris for a final group project (Software Design IV: Software Architecture and System Design course). The game was developed by our team using the documents created by another team throughout the semester and communicating with the other team as necessary.
